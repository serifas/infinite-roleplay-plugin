The moderation team reserves the right to remove content and ban users at their discretion and without warning. 
Repeatedly skirting around rules may result in a warning.
Members will receive a warning for their first offense if not stated as a bannable offence above, a kick lasting 24 hours
for their second offense, and a ban for their third offense.
Warnings may be forgiven after three months of good behavior.
Warnings are sent through DMs from the moderation team in discord. 
If your server privacy settings are set to disable or you are not in the discord server at all
direct DMs from server members, you will not know the reason for your warning, kick, or ban.
Members blocking moderators is not allowed. This is to ensure moderators can properly moderate and enforce the rules of the community. 
Members can appeal moderation that they disagree with by contacting an admin.
Report to a moderator and block anyone who makes you feel unsafe, keep reports to a minimum.
Do not report profiles for just making you uncomfy. It must break our rules to be a reportable offense.
Repeat reports of someone without them breaking the Rules or ToS can get you a strike or ban.
